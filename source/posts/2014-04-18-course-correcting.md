If you're over 20, your [brain is probably in decline](http://youtu.be/UyPrL0cmJRs). Since I'm nearer to 40, this is pretty much a certainty. We may be blind to this fact because we are constantly learning new things and gaining life experience. But gaining knowledge is not the same as gaining *ability to learn*.

What really impressed me about that video was the influence of *noise* on mental well being.

Addressing this noise in my own life is important for doing meaningful work, but more importantly, simply to be healthy and happy. So what are the sources of noise in my own life? Here's a few:

1. **Family**: Don't get me wrong - being a husband and father of two amazing little girls is the greatest joy of my life and I wouldn't trade it for anything. But if I'm not proactive and creative about managing it, it becomes easy to lose myself in the process. This is a [great article about flowing with the stress of family life](http://zenhabits.net/are-we-there-yet/).

2. **Work**: I am very lucky to have a comparatively quiet work environment. But it's still important to be very intentional about identifying those thing that prevent me from deep and meaningful engagement in my work.

3. **Information**: The business of keeping up to date on *the new* can become an all-consuming effort. It is important, but it can also be a kind of noise that becomes purely a distraction.

For me
