title: Hashtag Search
---

As a sideline to one of my bigger projects, I decided to build a little webapp that would search Twitter for a hashtag. Fairly basic, but it's got a few interesting little features:

*   Name &amp; profile pics link to user's profile
*   Inline URL's are converted to links
*   'More' button loads more tweets via AJAX
