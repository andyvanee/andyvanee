title: Git Whyto
---
<p>There are plenty of Git howto's on the internet, instead I think many
people need a Git <em>whyto</em>. This guide is specifically focused on using
Git and GitHub for personal projects like writing, publishing and
creative work.</p>

<h3>1. Complete Content Control</h3>

<p>Git basically tracks any folder you tell it to. As you make changes to
files, you can commit the changes, roll back the changes or create
branches to try out alternate paths without messing with the main
branch. You then <em>push</em> these changes to GitHub, which is simply a
mirror of the files on-disk.</p>

<h3>2. Responsibile Collaboration</h3>

<p>It's easy to add others as collaborators on your project, and easy to
see what, when and how much they changed. Any changes that you don't
agree with are easily rolled back to previous versions.</p>

<h3>3. Tracking Intentions</h3>

<p>Each time you commit a change, you write a short description of the
change. This helps you to get a sense of where the project is at, what
you were thinking, and what still needs work.</p>

<h3>4. Scalable Projects</h3>

<p>Personal projects start out small, but there is a chance one of them
may catch fire and become a big idea. Git works well with a single
contributor or thousands of contributors. And if the project takes
off, you will have the track record of the entire project right from
the first commit.</p>

<h3>5. Universal Appeal</h3>

<p>Git was designed for software projects but it really has many
compelling features for any project, from thesis to portfolio to
presentation. System-wide backup plans like Time Machine are great on
the large scale, Git allows the same kind of snapshots on a
per-folder basis but adds the ability to merge, clone and modify these
snapshots across many computers.</p>

<p>One <em>slight</em> problem with GitHub is that the free version only allows
public projects (view and download).</p>

<p>If your project is private you can always just use git on your
personal computer, zip the folder and back it up to Google Docs. You
can then unzip the folder to any other computer and it will work with
git exactly as it should. Or, alternatively, you could keep your
master on an external hard drive and merge changes from your laptop,
desktop and work computers without a problem.</p>
