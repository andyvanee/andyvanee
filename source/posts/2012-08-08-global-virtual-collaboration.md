I have a feeling that the current age could be described as the dawn of
the open-source model. It's not just software that can benefit from a
workflow that is distributed, versioned and collaborative. And it's not
only "open" products that benefit from these tools. Here's a great
example of this at work in the latest Mars rover:

"Global virtual collaboration" really stuck out for me. It's rather
obvious how this enables far more productive engineering teams when put
this way. What's not always obvious is how and where this workflow really
should be introduced in other fields.
