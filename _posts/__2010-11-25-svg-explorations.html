title: SVG Explorations

<p>SVG seems to have got buried under all the hype about the HTML5 canvas. But it's really quite cool and I'm surprised more sites aren't using it for dynamic content.</p><br />
<p>Part of the problem seems to be early and inconsistent implementation. A lot of the demos that are floating about the web are old, uninspiring and bland. Some good examples can be found on <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">the raphael.js site</a> and a decent example of a full page built with SVG is <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">emacsformacosx.com</a>.</p><br />
<p>I've built a small example using CSS styling and JavaScript mouseover events to randomly rotate each path in an image I "traced" using Illustrator.</p><br />

<p style="color: #AA3333;">Update: Apparently Google Graphs(a spreadsheet option) are rendered with SVG. Cool!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3761776372224414205-970291564110915411?l=amxor.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div>
