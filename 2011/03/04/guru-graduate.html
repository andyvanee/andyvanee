  <p>Well, today was my last day at <a href='http://www.gurudigitalarts.com/'>Guru Digital Arts College</a>. It&#8217;s been an amazing six months! I had a great feeling about the school from the day I walked in for a tour, and they didn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>

<p>The staff at Guru were a fantastic bunch: passionate about providing the best education possible for students with a wide range of talents and goals. They provided sage advice on project management and the business as well as hands-on practical instruction on the tools and techniques.</p>

<p>The education was highly tailored to my skill set. After a whirlwind tour of Adobe CS to make sure I was up to speed, I jumped on to a couple projects focusing on client-side JavaScript. They also brought in a great guest instructor to get some good hands on experience with developing iOS apps with Objective-C. In the latter half of the program, I started working more with server-side technologies. I worked with CouchDB, Google App Engine and Ruby on Rails; integrating them with, and further developing my knowledge of iOS and client-side JavaScript.</p>

<p>I presented my portfolio to a panel of industry professionals today, and the feedback was great. It was awesome to be able to present it and see what aspects really resonate with people.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t the end, it&#8217;s only the beginning. The reason I built this site to be dynamic and extensible is because I plan to keep growing, learning and building cool stuff, and I want to share it with the world!</p>
