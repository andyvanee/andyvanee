  <p>School has started and I've been very busy with projects, but haven't
had time to write. And in fact there's not a lot to write about. Sure,
I've been working on a lot of cool stuff, but the big picture hasn't
come into focus.</p>

<p>Along with getting a grip on the Adobe tools (Photoshop, Illustrator,
Flash/AS), there's the programming.</p>

<p>One of the best insights that I've got so far is how powerful pencil
and paper can be. Storyboarding, brainstorming and sketching use cases
are a great way to think about a project from all angles. If you sit
down and start coding without any clear direction, you are wasting a
lot of thought on design and abstract principles, when you need to
focus that brainpower on making <em>sensible code</em>. Working this way, 
a lot of coding design patterns start to emerge before you even begin
coding.</p>

<p>And maybe that's the one <em>bigger picture</em> that is coming into view:
learning to divide and conquer is vital to any project, even if it's
just a one man show.</p>
