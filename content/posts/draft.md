In my last post I made the bold proclaimation that software (design, development and ops), are only going to increase with the dawn of AI-assissted development. While I think this is true in the long term, I am not so sure in the short term.

When everything is changing under your feet, it only makes sense to take a measured response. It's unreasonable to try to compete with the wild claims across news feeds everywhere but it's equally unreasonable to pretend that it's just business as usual in our industry.

I have made some very substantial career changes but I don't remember any feeling as substantial as this one. It scares me.

The uncertainty doesn't bother me as much as the feeling that I may be looking too far into the future.

### The democratization of software

And by "democratization", I mean it primarily in this sense:

> A shift in power from a small elite group to a wider range of citizens

Does this mean software quality will suffer? Absolutely. I don't think there's any way around the fact that the quality bar for web and native apps is going to continue to drop substantially. But along with this shift come two upsides:

- Less incentive to build, ship, and use suboptimal products
- Massive opportunity to build things that were just not possible before

And it is the second point which has me excited and nervous.

### De-specialization

When I started in software about 15 years ago, it was somewhat of a specialist role. Not on par with brain surgeon or astronaut, but certainly more specialized than construction worker.

This is becoming less true as time goes on, and I'm am actively changing strategy as time goes on.

I see the future of software development as much more of a generalist role, which is why I believe that
