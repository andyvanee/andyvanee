Peter Norvig is a big name in computer programming. I stumbled across some of
his code and was struck by how he could often accomplish in 4 lines of code
things that might take me pages.

A bit more searching led me to a course taught by Peter on Udacity
[Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212)

There were a number of places where I was absolutely blown away. Almost always
it was a case of me over-engineering the problem (usually with unneccesary OOP)
where his simple data types and list comprehensions nailed it.
