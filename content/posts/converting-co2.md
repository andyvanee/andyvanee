I had an idea as I was driving today. It seems so obvious that I'm sure it has
some fundamental flaw. Either that, or someone is already working on it. I'm
writing this only in the hopes that a Chemist or Biologist can explain to me how
I'm wrong and why I'm wrong.

We have a problem with CO₂ in the atmosphere. Politicians and environmental
groups are hard at work bringing in regulation regarding the amounts of CO₂ we
are putting into the atmosphere. But is anyone working on **removing** CO₂ from
the atmosphere?

My idea is this - build machines which will convert atmospheric CO₂ back into
Carbon and Oxygen.

It's not as if CO₂ is some exotic molecule or radioactive waste. It's one of the
simplest and most common molecules on earth. It is subject to many of the most
common chemical transformations possible.

What if we could design "solar panels" or filtration units which operated like
synthetic chlorophyll, extracting carbon and producing oxygen? Surely some type
of positive result could be gained through the process in addition to the
environmental benefit?

I'm not a biologist or chemist, so this might be a thoroughly impractical for
any number of reasons I haven't thought about. But - what if?

#### Addendum

I intentionally wrote this before Googling. As a programmer, it some times feels
like I'm just a professional search-engine operator. It's nice to just spend
some time **thinking** about a problem, rather than immediately jumping to the
solution. That being said, I was quite satisfied with the result once I did
search.

The "answer" is that it's a good idea being pioneered by some very smart
people, but not yet ready for widespread use on the "Climate Change" scale.

We need people on this.
