                        <p>This post caught my eye: Why you need a home lab to keep your job.
Your boss won&#39;t pay for training, so your partner has to put up with servers at home What intrigued me, as a web developer, was not setting up servers with the latest and greatest hardware. It was the question of what exactly the ‘Home Lab’ looks like for a web developer. I have a number of things cooking in my home lab but I’m thinking I really should have more. These are non-paying projects, built for fun or necessity or just to develop my skills with tools I don’t use at work. Here’s a rundown of a couple of them:

                        <p>I’ve been learning Haskell. It’s been a very interesting experience to learn to think in the Haskell way, but I have been unsure whether it will actually have any practical benefit in my day to day work.

                        <p>I have a feeling that the current age could be described as the dawn of the open-source model. It’s not just software that can benefit from a workflow that is distributed, versioned and collaborative. And it’s not only “open” products that benefit from these tools. Here’s a great example of this at work in the latest Mars rover:

MVC has long been the defacto standard for building web and desktop applications. There are many variations on the theme, but I think the acronym is missing one component that is already an important part of any MVC application…

                        <p>Finder makes it a bit difficult to get the full path to a file; like when you’re pasting it into config files or Terminal.
So here’s a little script that makes it this easy: Browse in Finder, right click a file or folder and choose ‘Copy Path to Clipboard’.

                        <p>This past weekend my co-worker, Jon, and I participated in the Global Day of Code Retreat, an event that focuses on two things: Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming.
Neither of which are exactly new to me, but in my day-to-day work there are only a handful of projects that use TDD, and we basically never do pair-programming. We collaborate, but never really in front of the same computer for any length of time.
