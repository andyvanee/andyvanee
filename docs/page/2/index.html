        Interesting slide deck here called
Clojure: The JFDI language

I haven’t done any Clojure programming, but I have done some lisp (sbcl) and
Haskell, so this off-the-cuff remark caught my attention:

        <p>Peter Norvig is a big name in computer programming. I stumbled across some of
his code and was struck by how he could often accomplish in 4 lines of code
things that might take me pages.</p>

<p>A bit more searching led me to a course taught by Peter on Udacity
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212">Design of Computer Programs</a></p>

<p>There were a number of places where I was absolutely blown away. Almost always
it was a case of me over-engineering the problem (usually with unneccesary OOP)
where his simple data types and list comprehensions nailed it.</p>

One reason, which is often addressed, is the challenge of effectively
communicating your ideas. This is partly technical, but has more to do with
how effectively you communicate...

        <p>In an effort to make the static site workflow a little less manual, I&rsquo;ve created a little web-service to automate things a bit. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit posts/pages/layouts etc with <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a></li>
<li>Github web-hook hits my service, triggering a build.</li>
</ol>

<p>The build stage looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>git pull (or clone if need be)</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>s3cmd sync</li>
</ol>

<p>Setting up the server was a bit difficult for a couple of reasons. My blog is pretty straightforward, but it did need a number of things installed on the server for a successful build: make, jekyll, uglifyjs, recess, pygments and s3cmd. Also, this all had to be run as the www-data user, which had a pretty minimal environment.</p>

<p>So far, it&rsquo;s awesome. Editing and publishing my blog as a static site on S3 is now completely automated. Code coming soon on <a href="https://github.com/Andyvanee">github</a>&hellip;</p>
