                        <p>Here’s an article I read a couple days ago about the founder of Udacity and his struggle with very low success rates for online courses.

                        <p>When I started reading [this article called CMS Trap](http://hakunin.com/cms- trap), I had no idea what the hell he was talking about. As I pushed through, I began saying ‘yes’ more and more, and by the time I was finished I had to go back and re-read it again because so much rang true.

I think this will be a nice setup :)

                        <p>…for a number of reasons.
One reason, which is often addressed, is the challenge of effectively communicating your ideas. This is partly technical, but has more to do with how effectively you communicate in any manner.
