                        <p>I’ve recently been working on a project that uses WebSockets as a core mechanic. These are my thoughts…
For starters, an event-driven architecture all the way from Server to UI brings some interesting features. Most notably, it allows you to think about the app as a single one-way rendering flow.

My solutions are here: https://github.com/andyvanee/adventofcode
I’m now on day 8, and the examples have ranged from very easy to pretty involved, but none have been devilishly complicated or tricky.

I’m going to use a broad definition of frameworks defined like this:

                        <p>Fonts and external scripts can be a real performance killer for modern websites. This is the white-screen of death for front-end web development. Anytime a page is blocked for 0.5 or more seconds due to scripts and hosts outside of your control is a serious problem in my opinion. The best solution is to completely sandbox your external scripts like social media widgets. Fonts could use similar treatment.

http://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb
To compensate for a high dropout rate, Udacity has made a shift to focusing on corporate training. Company sponsored courses on the practical tools and frameworks that are used today. These courses are generally taught by corporate “Technology Evangelists”, or some such title.
