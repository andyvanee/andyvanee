      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a project that uses WebSockets as a core mechanic. These are my thoughts&amp;hellip;
For starters, an event-driven architecture all the way from Server to UI brings some interesting features.</description>

      <description>Deconstruct 2017 is over, and I&amp;rsquo;m still processing a lot of what I heard, but I did want to get a few notes down while the ideas are fresh.
It came up a few times that the software community needs to do better in terms of inclusivity and overcoming the biases that have accumulated.</description>

      <description>I had an idea as I was driving today. It seems so obvious that I&amp;rsquo;m sure it has some fundamental flaw. Either that, or someone is already working on it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve really been enjoying working my way through the code challenges at http://adventofcode.com/.
My solutions are here: https://github.com/andyvanee/adventofcode
I&amp;rsquo;m now on day 8, and the examples have ranged from very easy to pretty involved, but none have been devilishly complicated or tricky.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Frameworks</title>

      <description>This may come across as a rant, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can keep this as objective as possible: I don&amp;rsquo;t like frameworks.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a broad definition of frameworks defined like this:</description>

      <guid>https://www.andyvanee.com/2014/03/29/sandbox-your-external-scripts.html</guid>
      <description>Fonts and external scripts can be a real performance killer for modern websites. This is the white-screen of death for front-end web development. Anytime a page is blocked for 0.5 or more seconds due to scripts and hosts outside of your control is a serious problem in my opinion.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an article I read a couple days ago about the founder of Udacity and his struggle with very low success rates for online courses.

To compensate for a high dropout rate, Udacity has made a shift to focusing on corporate training.</description>

      <description>When I started reading this article called CMS Trap, I had no idea what the hell he was talking about. As I pushed through, I began saying &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; more and more, and by the time I was finished I had to go back and re-read it again because so much rang true.</description>

      <description>Interesting slide deck here called Clojure: The JFDI language
I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any Clojure programming, but I have done some lisp (sbcl) and Haskell, so this off-the-cuff remark caught my attention:</description>

      <description>Peter Norvig is a big name in computer programming. I stumbled across some of his code and was struck by how he could often accomplish in 4 lines of code things that might take me pages.</description>

      <description>OpenResty is a bit of an enigma. I first heard about the project a few months back when reading about some benchmarks of various web application platforms. OpenResty was WAY ahead of all the others.</description>

      <description>When Google announced that Reader was to be no more, I, like many other geeks took things into my own hands. I was, until recently, a daily user of Reader. There are only a handful of RSS feeds that I follow, but I like them for the very fact that they are not Rich content or an Immersive Experience.</description>

One reason, which is often addressed, is the challenge of effectively communicating your ideas. This is partly technical, but has more to do with how effectively you communicate in any manner.</description>

Your boss won&#39;t pay for training, so your partner has to put up with servers at home What intrigued me, as a web developer, was not setting up servers with the latest and greatest hardware.</description>

Neither of which are exactly new to me, but in my day-to-day work there are only a handful of projects that use TDD, and we basically never do pair-programming.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just picked up Gene Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s collection of short stories, &amp;ldquo;Endangered Species&amp;rdquo; for a second read. I stopped after the introduction to think about it for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s that good.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been bugging me for a while that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the method behind jQuery&amp;rsquo;s function chaining. So I built the smallest functional version of it. I call it aQuery (for andy, or awesome).</description>

      <description>Developing native apps is a pain. Yes, you have the luxury of fixed screen dimensions and access to hardware features that may not be available elsewhere, but when you&amp;rsquo;re done, you have an app that only works on one platform.</description>

      <description>School has started and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy with projects, but haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to write. And in fact there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot to write about. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a lot of cool stuff, but the big picture hasn&amp;rsquo;t come into focus.</description>

      <title>Photo Archiving</title>

      <description>Backups and Archives are two different things. Ideally you should have a good archiving system, and your backup would be a redundant copy of that.
In photography, a robust archiving system has between two and four copies of any file.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging a fair bit lately about metadata, archiving and dealing with the masses of information that we produce and consume today.
It all comes from an idea that has been alternatively percolating and distilling in my mind.</description>

      <description>One interesting part of the weekend photographic seminar I just got back from was the emphasis on metadata.
It&#39;s important to take great photos, but it&#39;s just as important to know how you got those results.</description>

      <description>Data is chaotic. Our attempts to tame it are largely attempts at dehumanizing ourselves. Here&amp;rsquo;s a transcript of a piece of cardboard on my Grandfathers wall:
------------------------- | | | WALLET LIST | | ------ | | EARS | | CANE | | WATCH | | | | SWIM | | | |_________________________|  Even by typing it here, I am imposing a fair bit more order than the original had.</description>

      <description>Software Engineers assume that your data can be ordered logically. This assumption is built in to the file system. They assume that it&#39;s an easy task, but that it&#39;s best left to the user.</description>

      <description>After reading &#34;The Art Of UNIX Programming&#34; again, it&#39;s got me thinking about the nature of the technological explosion that has happened since the quaint days of mainframes and text-based consoles.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m away from my Linux box and want to do some assembly programming. Mac installs GCC with the developer tools, but there are enough differences that I haven&amp;rsquo;t bothered to work through them until now.</description>

      <description>disclaimer: I copied this from my old blog. Not sure if it actually works:)
My calculator code was quite easily polished up. Here&amp;rsquo;s the revised code which stacks operands properly and supports the main arithmetic operators +, -, * , /.</description>
