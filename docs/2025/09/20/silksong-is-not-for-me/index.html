                <h1>Silksong is not for me</h1>
                <time>September 20, 2025</time>
                <p>Like many other Hollow Knight fans, I awaited the release of Silksong for years. According to my steam stats, I have over 500 hours into the original game and anticipated being taken in by a much larger map and the downright gorgeous art and music of the game.</p>
<p>Once I dove in though, I quickly realized that Silksong was probably not the game for me.</p>
<p>I got about 12 hours in completely spoiler free, exploring the map and doing my best to get comfortable with the gameplay. I beat a few punishing bosses like Moorwing and Fourth Chorus without any hints or spoilers. But as the grind continued, I felt very little sense of accomplishment and very little satisfaction in clearing areas.</p>
<p>After realizing that I was a bit stuck on what to do next, I resorted to watching the streams of Skurry and Fireborn to get a sense of where to explore next and how the map would open up. This gave me enough to go on that I put another 5 hours into the game. With a few pointers about where to go next and what upgrades to look for, I had a bit more motivation to continue. But more importantly, I realized that these players were clearing bosses first or second try that took me 50 attempts. These hours solidified my growing unease that I was simply not up to the task.</p>
<h3 id="casual-gaming">Casual gaming</h3>
<p>Let me rewind a bit. I strongly identify as a casual gamer. At most, I put 5-10 hours per week into gaming and may go weeks without gaming. I have a career and other hobbies that rank as high or higher than gaming. But having a casual gamer schedule is not entirely equivalent to only liking casual games - I do like difficult challenges and pushing my limits once in a while.</p>
<p>The games I tend to like are the ones that you can pick up for a bit, jump into some fairly self-contained challenge, exploration or building and then put it down. Most critically, I like games where you can pick up where you left off days or weeks after putting it down.</p>
<p>The original Hollow Knight was challenging at this pace, but not impossible. I got completely stuck on the Watcher Knights and Hornet II during my original playthrough, but with some tips and practice I was able to get past them and feel enough mastery that they wouldn&rsquo;t be as hard on successive playthroughs.</p>
<p>Silksong, from what I&rsquo;ve seen thus far, requires far more time than I have to give. Like Celeste, which I bounced off for the same reason, Silksong feels way more like cumulative - you must devote substantial hours and have very little downtime to feel ready for the next challenge. After watching some of the later game content, I&rsquo;m fairly sure that I don&rsquo;t have the hours left in my life to see a game ending for myself.</p>
<p>Let me be clear - I think I am very atypical in this regard. The pattern I enjoy most in Hollow Knight is the following, which can be contained to 3-5 sessions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early game (up to Crystal Heart)</li>
<li>Nail upgrades and Nail arts</li>
<li>Late game (Dreamers and HK)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hard-games">Hard games</h3>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re getting the impression that I&rsquo;m completely soft, I have been able to complete some pretty tough achievements with this approach such as Steel Heart (4.2% of players) and Speedrun 2 (4.9% of players). I don&rsquo;t have anything against difficult games, but I think there are limits where the tradeoffs diminish for someone like me. That limit - for Silksong specifically - was when I started regularly dying ON THE WAY to the boss fight.</p>
<p>Do I want an &ldquo;easy mode&rdquo;? Absolutely. 100% yes. I would love to have a casual walk through the world of Pharloom on my own machine without hitting the wall less than 10% into the game. I would love to experience the lore and music and art on my own. I don&rsquo;t get the sense that this will come from Team Cherry, but I will be keeping my eye out for any mods which add this in the coming months.</p>
<h3 id="regret">Regret</h3>
<p>I considered requesting a refund from Steam. My current total is 17 hours and I would guess I am less than 10% into the game, which is not where I expected to be when purchasing the game. But I came to the conclusion that the price was absolutely worth it considering the time I&rsquo;ve spent in both games. Though I may not experience the later game content myself, there is a wealth of Streamers and YouTubers I can watch to see it and will be waiting for the Mossbag lore video.</p>
<h3 id="just-buy-it">Just Buy It</h3>
<p>Team Cherry has made the game they wanted to make and I absolutely love that. From everything I&rsquo;ve heard, they are a shining star in the world of games and tech more broadly. I want to support that and validate their right to do so.</p>
<p>I hope that with coming balance patches and tuning, the game will become more accessible to a wider range of players, but I&rsquo;m not holding out any hope that it will get to where I need it to be while satisfying the hardcore players. Without a separate game mode or something, it is an irreconcilable gap considering the scale and breadth of the game.</p>
<p>With all these things in mind, I would still recommend the game to anyone that enjoys a challenge. Maybe you&rsquo;ll only get 15 hours into it and bounce off like I did, but I still consider that a solid win given the work that Team Cherry has put into it and the super low price tag.</p>
