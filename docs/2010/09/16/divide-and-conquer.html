                <h1>Divide And Conquer</h1>
                <time>September 16, 2010</time>
                <p>School has started and I&rsquo;ve been very busy with projects, but haven&rsquo;t
had time to write. And in fact there&rsquo;s not a lot to write about. Sure,
I&rsquo;ve been working on a lot of cool stuff, but the big picture hasn&rsquo;t
come into focus.</p>

<p>Along with getting a grip on the Adobe tools (Photoshop, Illustrator,
Flash/AS), there&rsquo;s the programming.</p>

<p>One of the best insights that I&rsquo;ve got so far is how powerful pencil
and paper can be. Storyboarding, brainstorming and sketching use cases
are a great way to think about a project from all angles. If you sit
down and start coding without any clear direction, you are wasting a
lot of thought on design and abstract principles, when you need to
focus that brainpower on making <em>sensible code</em>. Working this way,
a lot of coding design patterns start to emerge before you even begin
coding.</p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the one <em>bigger picture</em> that is coming into view:
learning to divide and conquer is vital to any project, even if it&rsquo;s
just a one man show.</p>
