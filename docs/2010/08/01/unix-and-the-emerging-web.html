            <h2>UNIX and the Emerging Web</h2>
            <div class="date">Aug 01, 2010</div>

        <p>After reading &ldquo;The Art Of UNIX Programming&rdquo; again, it&rsquo;s got me thinking about the
nature of the technological explosion that has happened since the
quaint days of mainframes and text-based consoles.</p>

<p>The two ideas that these legendary computer scientists cared greatly about and
seem to be dissolving today are <em>ownership</em> and <em>simple formats</em>.</p>

<h4>Ownership</h4>

<p>Web-based services take a certain level of trust. The user gives control of
their data to a service provider <em>in trust</em>. By doing so, there is a subtle
loss of control by the user. We end up with bits of content all over the web
that may or may not be accessible or editable by us.</p>

<p>There has been some recent development to build a unified &ldquo;user space&rdquo; like
OpenID, but in my alternate history of the internet, user profiles would have
expanded beyond the workstation into a worldwide user space. Up until now, the
user space was determined by email accounts, but with the shifting landscape of
email services this was not really a practical solution. </p>

<p>In my alternate history, instead of email accounts, user profile would be
generated like IP addresses, and could be linked to email accounts or any
other service. Maybe this just seems too <em>big brother</em> for the average user. It
would enable much easier tracking of the web services and content that is linked
to your profile. I think this would be incredibly convenient for managing your
online history; the services you&rsquo;ve used and the content you&rsquo;ve generated.</p>

<h4>Simple Formats</h4>

<p>In the UNIX days, plain text was the format of choice for almost anything.
Today, raw emails remain more-or-less human readable, but that&rsquo;s about it. Every
new web service and application introduces their own formats and interfaces.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just dreaming, but I think that with some work, text formats could
work in the context of most popular web services. Twitter, for example, is
simply a collection of text notes with the date as metadata. So why not
integrate it with the desktop workflow?</p>

<p>The reason is that web browsers have been designed to be very isolated from the
desktop, and the only way to break this isolation is with downloadable formats
or task-specific applications that can bridge the gap. Again, email clients are
the classic example of a task specic application that grabs a stream of
information with a secret handshake and delivers content to the user.</p>

<p>What I envision here is a two-way RSS folder using a universal keychain and
managed with something like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. But what this requires
is that the web service and browser be given read/write access to the folder. I
think this model is fairly incompatible with the current state of web
technology.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>In some ways, I think that the values of the UNIX crowd are coming full circle
with emerging web trends. <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a> has been
blogging for years about the potential of a web that&rsquo;s as easy to write as it is
to read.
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/beyond_social_web_internet_of_things.php">This post</a>
 is a good summary of emerging trends like structured data. But I think that to
really acheive this flexibility, internet and desktop architecture needs to
adapt and build robust standards to allow it to happen.</p>

<p><p>The problem isn&rsquo;t access to services, it&rsquo;s the completely sandboxed environment
of the web browser. If we truly want to see the potential of web applications
and services, we need a way to let the web in.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3761776372224414205-4655558995860459269?l=amxor.blogspot.com" width="1" /></div></p>
