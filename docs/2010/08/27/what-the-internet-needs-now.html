            <h2>What The Internet Needs Now</h2>
            <div class="date">Aug 27, 2010</div>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging a fair bit lately about metadata, archiving and
dealing with the masses of information that we produce and consume
today.</p>

<p>It all comes from an idea that has been alternatively percolating and
distilling in my mind. It&rsquo;s the idea of stability.</p>

<p>The internet age is highly energized and highly transient. The next
big thing comes along, is adopted by huge masses of people, and
is discarded in a matter of months or years. Examples abound, but my
working example is waning interest in Facebook.</p>

<p>I recently printed a PDF of my entire facebook history because I&rsquo;m a
dork and find that type of thing interesting. I just kept scrolling
down and clicking &ldquo;Older Posts&rdquo; until I reached the &ldquo;Andy joined
Facebook&rdquo; post. Here are my findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s only a 36 page PDF (small font though). Though it would be
more.</li>
<li>I joined in June 2007.</li>
<li>My first friend is someone I haven&rsquo;t spoken to since.</li>
<li>My first status update is still one of my favorite quotes: &ldquo;The
chief enemy of creativity is good taste. - Pablo Picasso&rdquo;</li>
<li>I was really into &ldquo;Graffiti&rdquo; in the early days. I printed those off
too.</li>
<li>I &ldquo;connected&rdquo; with many people that I had forgotten about for years.
Then promtly forgot about them again! Some I genuinely want to keep
in touch with though, so that&rsquo;s good.</li>
<li>I wish there was a graphic scale of friend numbers. I think it would
resemble a logarithmic curve, rapidly rising, but plateauing at
around 220.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a silly game, but I find it alarming that we invest so much
time into something that is probably doomed to extinction or, more
likely, habituation. Facebook has become an e-mail replacement and
when is the last time you were truly excited about e-mail?</p>

<p>The tool has become stable: less exciting, but stable. The end result
is a tool that is far less robust and stable technically than the one
it replaced. E-mail may be getting archaic, but it is a completely
open and robust mechanism that is largely independant of any specific
implementation. Facebook on the other hand is completely tied to
corporate interest and a locked down API.</p>

<p>I think we must all make a conscious effort to aim for stability in
the turbulent age we live in. To research the tools we use and what
the long term strategy is for them. And for those who are in the
business of creating the tools, to think long and hard about how
robust the system is in the long term. Is a locked and site-specific
format necessary? (no, never!) Is your user policy going to limit the
long-term viability of the system?</p>

<p>In the case of this blog, I&rsquo;ve made a conscious decision to keep
control of the content. The site is just the publishing medium, the
actual product, for me, is just a folder of plain-text files on my hard
drive in chronological order. It may not look flashy with
fixed-width fonts and markdown formatting, but it&rsquo;s simple, stable and
guaranteed to work long into the future.</p>
