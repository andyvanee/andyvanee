                <h1>Assembly Language For Mac</h1>
                <time>March 3, 2010</time>
                <p>I&rsquo;m away from my Linux box and want to do some assembly
programming. Mac installs GCC with the developer tools, but there are
enough differences that I haven&rsquo;t bothered to work through them until
now. Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://shorestreet.com/node/21">a decent tutorial</a>,
although it focuses on PPC assembly and I&rsquo;m using an Intel Mac. The
thing that frightened me about the Mac assembler was the default
output of gcc -S. There is some strange optimizations and flags in the
resulting assembly code. The key, as the tutorial points out, is in
the compiler options. Here&rsquo;s what I used on the ubiquitous &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; program:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -S -fno-PIC -O2 -Wall -o hello.s hello.c
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the assembly code it spit out:</p>

<pre><code>.cstring
LC0:
   .ascii &quot;Hello World!%d\12\0&quot;
   .text
   .align 4,0x90

.globl _main
   _main:
   pushl   %ebp
   movl    %esp, %ebp
   subl    $24, %esp
   movl    $12, 4(%esp)
   movl    $LC0, (%esp)
   call    _printf
   xorl    %eax, %eax
   leave
   ret
   .subsections_via_symbols
</code></pre>

<p>This is more familiar territory, the only differences being the
<code>.cstring</code> directive instead of <code>.section .text</code>, the leading underscore
on printf, and the <code>.subsections_via_symbols</code> directive. The general
naming of sections is outlined on the Mac Assembler Reference, and the
<code>.subsections_via_symbols</code> explanation is interesting. I&rsquo;m already used
to using many labels in my code; does this mean that the named
sections would be ripped out because they are not &ldquo;called&rdquo; by any
other code? I tested this out in the previous example, just adding a
second call to <code>_printf</code> in a labelled section and the code worked just
fine. It seems that labels don&rsquo;t count, they have to be declared
sections like <code>.globl</code>, <code>.section</code> or whatever. That seems fair, I haven&rsquo;t
yet made a habit of calling sections that are supposed to flow
naturally into other sections. Maybe there is some instance where this
might be a useful optimization? I will be looking into Position
Independent Code(PIC) a bit more, it seems that it&rsquo;s similar in theory
to how the latest Linux kernel runs code at randomized memory
locations to prevent hardcoded attacks, but I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the
extent of it.</p>
