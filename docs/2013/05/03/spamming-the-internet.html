                <h1>Spamming the Internet</h1>
                <time>May 3, 2013</time>
                <p>When Google announced that Reader was to be no more, I, like many other geeks took things into my own hands. I was, until recently, a daily user of Reader. There are only a handful of RSS feeds that I follow, but I like them for the very fact that they are not <strong>Rich content</strong> or an <strong>Immersive Experience</strong>.</p>

<p>They are plain-text, pure content.</p>

<p>My solution was pretty ghetto, I must admit. I set up a <a href="http://feedr.andyvanee.com/">wordpress blog</a> and set up <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> to watch some of my favorite feeds and re-post them there automatically. It was a couple hours setup, and a few minutes setting up the AJAXy goodness of inline expanding posts.</p>

<p>It was only today that I found one of the posts in a google search result. Weird.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend that this is original content, and I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that what I&rsquo;m doing is permissable. In my defense, every post links to the original source, and many (Hacker News, in particular) are links with no other content.</p>

<p>But it really got me thinking about what the next stage in the evolution of the internet might look like. Lets say stage 1 was about publishing. Not really <em>big media</em> publishing; just making your voice heard and communicating. And stage 2 was about interacting. Linking, commenting and dialogue. I&rsquo;m going to say stage 3 is about living. People putting huge amounts of their life on the internet just because that&rsquo;s where they live. Not really seeking a reaction or looking for pageviews or <em>likes</em> or whatever. Just existing on the internet.</p>

<p>But humanity is not the only inhabitant of the web. My robot assistant will testify to that. My aggregator is gathering stuff for me to read and, as a side effect, publishing something that someone else may like to read too. No longer am I posting stuff that I want others to hear, or that I want others to engage with. I am farming out robots to post stuff purely for my own consumption.</p>

<p>So my question is: am I spamming the internet? Or is this the fourth stage of the internet? A stage where original, human produced content is just a small droplet in the ocean of automatically generated content.</p>

<p>Funny story, I found this post from completely unrelated search terms hitting feedr.</p>

<p>IMO you&rsquo;re fine, re-distributing content is pretty normal. You could always slap a robots.txt on feedr.</p>

<p>Good point. A robots.txt would effectively make it a non-issue. The problem with that is that I think I <em>do</em> want it available in search results. I just wish there was some human &amp; machine friendly way of saying &ldquo;hey, this is not original content, but feel free to bookmark and index it if you like&rdquo;.</p>
