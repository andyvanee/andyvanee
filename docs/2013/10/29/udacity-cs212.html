                <p>Peter Norvig is a big name in computer programming. I stumbled across some of
his code and was struck by how he could often accomplish in 4 lines of code
things that might take me pages.</p>

<p>A bit more searching led me to a course taught by Peter on Udacity
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212">Design of Computer Programs</a></p>

<p>There were a number of places where I was absolutely blown away. Almost always
it was a case of me over-engineering the problem (usually with unneccesary OOP)
where his simple data types and list comprehensions nailed it.</p>
