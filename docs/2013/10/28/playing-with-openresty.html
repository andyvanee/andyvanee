                <p><a href="http://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a> is a bit of an enigma. I first heard about
the project a few months back when reading about some benchmarks of various
web application platforms. OpenResty was WAY ahead of all the others.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that OpenResty is just Lua code embedded directly into the
nginx server. I had to try it out for myself.</p>

<p>I was pretty ambitious for my first explorations with OpenResty. I&rsquo;ve had
this project in the back of my mind for a bit, and I thought it would be
perfect for OpenResty. The idea is this:</p>

<p>Makefile-style dependency driven programming with the &ldquo;files&rdquo; living in
Redis. You write the source &ldquo;files&rdquo; to Redis as well as documents that outline
what dependencies will create a target file. This way, you can request a
file from the server that doesn&rsquo;t exist, but the server knows how to build it.
Some minimal templating will be built in as well.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t got too far with it, but thought I&rsquo;d share a bit of how it is going.</p>

<p>First off, Lua can be pretty bizarre. There are a number of key ideas for
programming Lua that I need to get more comfortable with to do any serious
work. Also the package management is mostly non-existant.</p>

<p>Second, since I couldn&rsquo;t really figure out how to test my Lua code properly
I&rsquo;ve just done totally decoupled testing with Python hitting the server over
HTTP. This has actually worked really well.</p>

<p>Third, the Lua code can be suspended and resumed at random by nginx. This can
wreak havoc with code that is not written with this in mind.</p>

<p>And finally, it&rsquo;s actually quite fun! It feels quite primitive, but the syntax
is not bad and the performance is incredible. Rather than writing code for
a process that&rsquo;s running independently of the server, it&rsquo;s like you are writing
code directly in the server.</p>

<p>Fun stuff!</p>
