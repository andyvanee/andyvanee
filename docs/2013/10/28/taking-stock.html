                <p>As I&rsquo;ve given this blog a little refresh, it&rsquo;s caused me to look back
on what I&rsquo;ve written so far and think about what I want to write in the
future.</p>
<p>My first reaction was embarrassment at some of the things I&rsquo;ve written
about. I actually deleted a couple posts, just because I thought they really
had no value whatsoever. My second thought was that I really like a few of
them, but they don&rsquo;t actually get the point across very well.</p>
<p>Here are a couple highlights:</p>
<p><a href="/2010/12/01/endangered-species-and-ux.html">Endangered Species and UX</a></p>
<p>Not really an informative title, and it doesn&rsquo;t really get to the point until
the last two paragraphs, but I still think it&rsquo;s an important point: Respect
the people you develop / design for.</p>
<p><a href="/2010/09/16/divide-and-conquer.html">Divide And Conquer</a></p>
<p>This one actually never really gets to the point, and I think that&rsquo;s partly
because I still need to get the point, especially in my writing: Anything that
is sufficiently complex requires planning, and the best way to plan is to
step back from the problem and work through it before marching ahead.</p>
<hr>
<p>Looking forward, I hope to start writing more regularly. I&rsquo;ve been tinkering
with lot&rsquo;s of new things, so I&rsquo;ll probably start with some quick summaries of
those things.</p>
