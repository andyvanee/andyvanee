            <h2>Converting Atmospheric CO₂</h2>
            <div class="date">May 19, 2016</div>

        <p>I had an idea as I was driving today. It seems so obvious that I&rsquo;m sure it has
some fundamental flaw. Either that, or someone is already working on it. I&rsquo;m
writing this only in the hopes that a Chemist or Biologist can explain to me how
I&rsquo;m wrong and why I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>We have a problem with CO₂ in the atmosphere. Politicians and environmental
groups are hard at work bringing in regulation regarding the amounts of CO₂ we
are putting into the atmosphere. But is anyone working on <strong>removing</strong> CO₂ from
the atmosphere?</p>

<p>My idea is this - build machines which will convert atmospheric CO₂ back into
Carbon and Oxygen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as if CO₂ is some exotic molecule or radioactive waste. It&rsquo;s one of the
simplest and most common molecules on earth. It is subject to many of the most
common chemical transformations possible.</p>

<p>What if we could design &ldquo;solar panels&rdquo; or filtration units which operated like
synthetic chlorophyll, extracting carbon and producing oxygen? Surely some type
of positive result could be gained through the process in addition to the
environmental benefit?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a biologist or chemist, so this might be a thoroughly impractical for
any number of reasons I haven&rsquo;t thought about. But - what if?</p>

<h4>Addendum</h4>

<p>I intentionally wrote this before Googling. As a programmer, it some times feels
like I&rsquo;m just a professional search-engine operator. It&rsquo;s nice to just spend
some time <strong>thinking</strong> about a problem, rather than immediately jumping to the
solution. That being said, I was quite satisfied with the result once I did
search.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;answer&rdquo; is that it&rsquo;s a good idea being pioneered by some very smart
people, but not yet ready for widespread use on the &ldquo;Climate Change&rdquo; scale.</p>

<p>We need people on this.</p>
