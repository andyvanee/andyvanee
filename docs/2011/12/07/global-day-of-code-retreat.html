                <h1>Global Day of Code Retreat</h1>
                <time>December 7, 2011</time>
                <p>This past weekend my co-worker, Jon, and I participated in the Global
Day of Code Retreat, an event that focuses on two things: Test-Driven
Development (TDD) and Pair Programming.</p>

<p>Neither of which are exactly new to me, but in my day-to-day work
there are only a handful of projects that use TDD, and we basically
never do pair-programming. We collaborate, but never really in front
of the same computer for any length of time.</p>

<p>The format was somewhat maddening for anyone that likes to see results
from their efforts which I&rsquo;m guessing is everyone. You get 45 minute
sessions, each with a new pairing, each with some new constraints, and
each potentially a new programming language to solve a problem that is
completely unsolvable in that span of time: Conway&rsquo;s Game Of Life. And
after each session the code must be deleted.</p>

<p>My first suprise of the day was the representation of programming
languages: of about 20 participants, all were either Java or C# guys,
with the exception of one Perl guy and us. I thought I would find more
common ground, having decent experience with PHP, Python, Javascript
(Node), Ruby and Objective-C. But no. The average programmer in
Calgary is thorougly entrenched in either Java or C#, often without
any experience whatsoever in the languages of the web and sysadmin
fields.</p>

<p>I ended up faking my way through C# for 4 out of 6 sessions. The C
heritage makes it fairly easy to guess the basics, and in 45 minutes,
you can&rsquo;t really test the limits of a language. The other 2 sessions
were with Node &amp; Ruby respectively, and they had their own problems.</p>

<p>In node, I had a outline for a TDD type project, but it turns out some
of the core stuff (requires etc.) has changed since using it last and
I spent probably 15 minutes actually getting the project running. In
the ruby session we decided to forget the test library completely and
use a single file with the classes and run the test functions within
it. Worked well enough, though I actually had a harder time jumping
into Ruby syntax initially than C#! That was bizarre to me.</p>

<p>Two of the &ldquo;programming constraints&rdquo; stick with me and I&rsquo;d like to
outline why:</p>

<p><em>1) No methods longer than 4 lines.</em></p>

<p>This is really hard! It really forces you to decompose the logic of
your code into bite sized chunks. It also makes it really easy to
check your logic at every step with test coverage.</p>

<p><em>2) No if/else/switch/case</em></p>

<p>This one is even harder, and I think i&rsquo;m still learning the lesson
within it. The way I see it is that it formalizes your comparison and
conditional branching. We started by getting around it with some ugly
boolean comparisons. But when we were forced to make a true
conditional branch, it started to become clear. The solution we came
up with, in C#, was to create a mapping of functions with a boolean
key. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>true -&gt; MethodToCall()
false -&gt; OtherMethodToCall()
</code></pre>

<p>And to do this, you also must create an interface that each of these
methods implements. This takes what would have been a block of inline
code and creates hooks that you could call and test independently of
the code that is calling it. That&rsquo;s pretty awesome actually.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a pretty good day. The language barriers were a bit
tough, but it&rsquo;s good exposure to see how other people work.</p>
