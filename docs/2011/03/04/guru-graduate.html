            <h2>Guru Graduate!</h2>
            <div class="date">Mar 04, 2011</div>

        <p>Well, today was my last day at
<a href="http://www.gurudigitalarts.com/">Guru Digital Arts College</a>. It&rsquo;s
been an amazing six months! I had a great feeling about the school
from the day I walked in for a tour, and they didn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>

<p>The staff at Guru were a fantastic bunch: passionate about providing
the best education possible for students with a wide range of talents
and goals. They provided sage advice on project management and the
business as well as hands-on practical instruction on the tools and
techniques.</p>

<p>The education was highly tailored to my skill set. After a whirlwind
tour of Adobe CS to make sure I was up to speed, I jumped on to a
couple projects focusing on client-side JavaScript. They also brought
in a great guest instructor to get some good hands on experience with
developing iOS apps with Objective-C. In the latter half of the
program, I started working more with server-side technologies. I
worked with CouchDB, Google App Engine and Ruby on Rails; integrating
them with, and further developing my knowledge of iOS and client-side
JavaScript.</p>

<p>I presented my portfolio to a panel of industry professionals today,
and the feedback was great. It was awesome to be able to present it
and see what aspects really resonate with people.</p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t the end, it&rsquo;s only the beginning. The reason I built
this site to be dynamic and extensible is because I plan to keep
growing, learning and building cool stuff, and I want to share it with
the world!</p>
