      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend my co-worker, Jon, and I participated in the Global&#xA;Day of Code Retreat, an event that focuses on two things: Test-Driven&#xA;Development (TDD) and Pair Programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither of which are exactly new to me, but in my day-to-day work&#xA;there are only a handful of projects that use TDD, and we basically&#xA;never do pair-programming. We collaborate, but never really in front&#xA;of the same computer for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
