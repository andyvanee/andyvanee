<p>Technology is advancing, but is it really advancing as fast as it
seems?</p>

<p>I might come across as a bit of a Luddite here, but I think that a lot
of the emerging software and hardware is ephemeral. And maybe that's
the way consumer electronics has to be. In the pre-dawn of the
internet, software was developed for aerospace, medicine and
government. It had to be robust, provable and enduring.</p>

<p>The landscape has changed completely. Today, developers have embraced
the ephemeral nature of apps, iPads and cell phones. They're not
worried about building enduring artifacts and code that will be
solid and transparent for a generation.</p>

<p>Perhaps hindsight is always myopic. There are plenty of criticisms
that judge the UNIX philosophy as being hackish; a virus that spread
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">"Worse is Better"</a>
philosophy of the the open source movement in general. But today, the
tools have been honed, pruned and documented so well that it all works
together as an organic whole. An organic whole that can be extended or
repurposed in ever new ways.</p>

<p>It is this sense of growth that seems lacking in the software and
hardware landscape of today. Code and hardware now go into the
landfill in a few years by default. Without the organic usefulness of
command-line programs, standalone apps have no value beyond a very
short life-cycle.</p>

<p>In a way, I think it's what had to happen. For most consumers, the
only interface that will get used is the one that is blatantly
obvious. They feel smart when the computer doesn't make them feel
stupid. And so user interface must appeal to the lowest common
denominator. I just feel a tiny shiver of remorse when I see the
amount of energy poured into technology that will be junked and
forgotten in months or years.</p>
