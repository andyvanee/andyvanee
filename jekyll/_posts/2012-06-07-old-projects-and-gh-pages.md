title: Old Projects onto Github Pages
---

I've moved my blog over to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and it's
working out pretty well so far. I'm using Jekyll to generate it, which works
awesome for a simple blog like this.

And in the spirit of embracing Github Pages, I've made gh-pages branches for a
couple of my dusty old projects that would work as static pages.

## Skratch

[The App](http://andyvanee.com/skratch/)  
[The Code](https://github.com/Andyvanee/skratch/tree/master/js)

I built Skratch as a school project, and looking at the code now I'm actually
quite happy with some of the design choices I made. Built in touch handling,
localStorage for drawings and a pretty sweet color picker. The drawing code
works pretty well too, some pretty funky stuff happening in skratch-tools.js in
the pencilDraw and penmove functions.

## Alien Quest

[The App](http://andyvanee.com/AlienQuest/)  
[The Code](https://github.com/Andyvanee/AlienQuest)

This was a fun little game. It's more or less just a wireframe of a game but
the gameplay is decent, and there's a few little treats in there. It was my
first and only real project using Prototype, so the code is a bit ugly in places
as a result.
