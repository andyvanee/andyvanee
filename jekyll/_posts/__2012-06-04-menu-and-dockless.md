title: Menu and Dockless

Another SIMBL plugin to do things to your Mac that were never
intended.

This can hide the top menu bar of pretty much any or all apps that you
are running. I've set it to default to no menu or dock on any apps,
and I'm quite enjoying it. I never would have said that the menu and
it's row of icons is particularly distracting, but living without them
has been strangely liberating.
